# FubuMVC

FubuMVC was originally created because of frustrations experienced when trying to override functionality in some of the other MVC frameworks, because of frustrations with
static typed languages, and because we wanted to do something truly different.

## So what makes it different?

We encourage you to see for yourself. We leverage compositional architecture, semantic models, and hardcore conventions to cook up a lot of "black magic". This isn't the
kind of C# you see everyday.

## Where's the documentation?

Yeah, we know. We've been criticized about this for a long time and it's still a problem. For now, hop on over to our Wiki.

What we lack in documentation, we make up for in response time in our mailing list. We welcome EVERY question and have a vibrant community willing to answer
questions at all hours of the day/night.

## Show me some examples

We have a working codebase that we're using for our documentation and screencasts. Take a look for an example of a barebones application:

## How do I get started?

The *easiest* way to get up and going is to install our FubuMVC.QuickStart.Spark package:

> Install-Package FubuMVC.QuickStart.Spark

Simply hit F5 and you'll be up and running. Welcome to the world of FubuMVC!
